1) Per-student analysis on performance, overall feeling of well-being, improvement of sentiment over time.
2) Detection of delibirate fooling of the system.
3) Bad language detection expansion and attempts to correct student about it if necessary.
4) Model improvements, re-learning (down stream) of models for applying to this specific case.
5) Student selection, better certainty about the model's accuracy that way. Right now, students can mess up positive, negative and additional messages, or the overall sentiment.
6) Integrate teacher part of FD in FD itself, where the website would be converted to a full React/Python backend version.
7) Outlier manual lookup and sentiment determination. Possibly even with auto-retraining behind the scenes based on this result.
8) Integration with AI Chatbot for students and teachers.
9) Make everything work with MongoDB, including analysis results. Currently, result JSON files are being used. MongoDB can just handle JSON no problem.
